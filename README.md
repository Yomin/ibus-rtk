       | left   | move cursor left through floating text
       | right  | move cursor right through floating text
       | home   | move cursor to begin of floating text
       | end    | move cursor to end of floating text
 ctrl  | left   | move cursor to primitive begin or begin of left primitive
 ctrl  | right  | move cursor to primitive end or end of right primitive

### input

Every non special purpose or ignored character is inserted into
floating text and additionally underlined. If 'space' is used to
start a new primitive a not underlined 'period' is inserted into
floating text. Normal periods will be underlined.

### lookup

If the lookup is successful the floating text is set to the
first found Kanji.
If the lookup failed every found primitive is colored green and
every unfound primitive is colored red.
